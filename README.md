# Global Burden of Diseases Mortality Results Analysis

## 📊 Overview
The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 estimated the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors across the globe and within 21 world regions for the years 1990 and 2010. A key dataset from this study, provided by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation [(IHME)](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/gbd-2010-mortality-results-1970-2010), includes the number of deaths and mortality rates by age group and sex for 187 countries, 21 regions, and globally—spanning the years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010.

This project analyzes global and regional mortality trends using the GBD 2010 data, with a focus on identifying how mortality rates vary by age group, region, and over time. Through data exploration and visualization in Python, the analysis aims to reveal key insights into mortality patterns and evolving public health priorities around the world.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Analyze mortality rates by age group, sex, and region over time (1970–2010) to identify patterns and disparities.
- Visualize trends in global and regional death rates to communicate key findings effectively.
- Explore changes between 1990 and 2010 to assess progress and remaining challenges in global health.

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Extremely high infant mortality dominates visuals unless adjusted.
- Male mortality rates consistently exceed female rates.
- Death rates declined significantly post-1990, but elderly rates remain steady.
- Clustering reveals disparities but requires more regional features for precision.
- Predictive modeling shows potential to forecast future trends in global mortality.
